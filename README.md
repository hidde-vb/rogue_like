# Rogue_Like

A WIP following the r/roguelikedev [tutorial](https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/part-1/), mainly to improve my python

## Notes on tooling

I use VS Code as my main editor. This means fiddling around to set everything up correctly.
 1. PyLance for python intellisense, no notes
 2. Uv for package management, nice upgrade for pip, venv and others
 3. Ruff for linting. this was a cumbersome to set up, but using python 3.13, ruff 0.12 and updating Code to the latest version did the trick.
